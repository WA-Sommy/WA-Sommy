- I'm just an average CS student trying her best to not be reduced to an avg job.
- I have created this github to track my proress along my coding journey
- I have been very intrested in a data related Project since I was 15 and am now taking the initiative to work on said project,
  I have been commened on this when I sought to execute it for my form 5 SBA and have since then never been able to get it out of my head.
- I am not sure where this project would take me, however I am intreted in it andd hence have made up mu mind to persue it.
